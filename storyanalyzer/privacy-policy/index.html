                <p class="text-muted text-justify"> ● Your IP address and mobile device identifiers (such as your device ID, advertising ID, MAC address, IMEI);</p>

                    all apps and thus allow crossapp tracking. On Apple you can opt-out this by choosing “limit ad tracking” option from privacy settings. On Google Android you can opt-out by choosing “Opt-out of interest based ads”.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-justify">Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers, which are uniquely associated with your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. These technologies allow companies (including marketers and advertisers)
