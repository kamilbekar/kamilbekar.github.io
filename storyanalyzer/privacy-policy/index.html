                for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple and Google
                Advertising Identity (“GAID”). These are unique identifiers for mobile device that advertisers
                use for interest based advertising. They are consistent across all apps and thus allow crossapp
                tracking. On Apple you can opt-out this by choosing “limit ad tracking” option from privacy
                settings. On Google Android you can opt-out by choosing “Opt-out of interest based ads”.</p>

            <p class="media-body pb-3 mb-0 small lh-125 ">Advertising IDs are non-permanent,
                non-personal identifiers, which are uniquely associated
                with your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. These technologies
                allow companies (including marketers and advertisers) to recognise your device when you
                use websites and applications.</p>
